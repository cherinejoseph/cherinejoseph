# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cherine-joseph/">Cherine</a>'s IT and Cybersecurity Project Portfolio üíª

My passion for IT and cybersecurity led me to specialize in protecting IT systems through vulnerability management, security operations, and threat hunting. I thrive on tackling complex challenges to secure networks, identify risks, and enhance security processes. As a dedicated #BlueTeam defender, my goal is to stay ahead of evolving threats and help build resilient IT infrastructures for every system I work with. Feel free to explore my work and see how I‚Äôm contributing to stronger, more secure systems.

## Education
- **Diploma in Cybersecurity and Threat Management**  
  *InTech Institute, 06/2024 ‚Äì 09/2024*  
  **Key Learnings:** Network Security, Threat Management, Penetration Testing, Risk Assessment, Incident Response, Vulnerability Analysis

  **Hands-On Labs:**
  - **Penetration Testing**: Conducted vulnerability assessments and exploitation techniques on simulated networks to identify and remediate security flaws.
  - **Incident Response**: Managed and investigated security breaches using tools like Wireshark and Splunk, simulating real-world cyber-attacks and response strategies.
  - **Network Security**: Configured firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS/IPS) to secure network infrastructures, focusing on mitigating common attack vectors like DDoS and SQL injection.
  - **Cryptography & Data Protection**: Applied encryption techniques to safeguard sensitive data, configuring SSL/TLS protocols and public-key infrastructures (PKI).

## Experience

**Cyber Security Support Analyst (Vulnerability Management & SecOps Intern)**  
*Log(N) Pacific, March 2020 - Present*

During my internship at **Log(N) Pacific**, I contributed to both **Vulnerability Management** and **Security Operations** (SecOps) efforts:

- **Vulnerability Management**: Performed vulnerability assessments and managed remediation efforts across **Windows** and **Linux** environments using tools like **Tenable** and **PowerShell**. I helped reduce vulnerabilities by 100% in critical areas and played a key role in ensuring compliance with industry security standards.
  
- **Security Operations**: Conducted **threat hunting** and responded to incidents involving brute force attacks, ransomware, and data exfiltration. I developed automated detection rules in **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** and built custom dashboards in **Microsoft Sentinel** to improve threat monitoring. My efforts significantly enhanced the company‚Äôs response time to potential security breaches.

- I gained hands-on experience with key security tools and methodologies, including **EDR**, **SIEM**, and **Kusto Query Language (KQL)**, while also fostering strong communication and collaboration across teams.
